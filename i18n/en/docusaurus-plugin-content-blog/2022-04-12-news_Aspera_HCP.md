Added pages for high-speed data transfer software Aspera and HCP tools.

- [Aspera page](/guides/software/CopyTool/aspera_client)

To upload files from NIG supercomputer or download files there, you can use 'scp' or 'sftp', which are widely used file transfer software. But 'scp' etc. have properties that their transfer speed slow down when many files are transfered for long distances.

For high-speed file tranefer for long distances, you can use file transfer software, Aspera for a general analysis division and HCP tools for a personal genome analysis division in the NIG supercomputer.
