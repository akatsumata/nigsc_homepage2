A power outage occurred at the National Institute of Genetics(NIG) on 5th September 2025, around 13:40.

The cause of the outage is currently under investigation, whether it was due to lightning associated with a typhoon or an internal issue at NIG. However, as the outage lasted more than five minutes, the NIG supercomputer system automatically shut down, resulting in a complete stoppage of the supercomputer.
