In this fiscal year (FY2022), due to the renewal of the application system in July 2022, there have been some system issues with end-of-year account renewal applications. We apologize for the inconvenience. For information on how to deal with this, [refer to FAQ](/faq/faq_renewal). 


In order to avoid confusion caused by the end-of-year renewal system issues, we decided to extend the end-of-year renewal deadline as follows.

## Period for renewal application

1 Jun 2023 - <font color="red">~~31 Mar 2023 (Friday)~~ extended to 7 May 2023 (Sunday)</font>
