## Period

November 24, 17:00 - November 30, 2023, 17:00(24h)


## Work schedule

- 11/24(Fri.) 17:00～ 　Supercomputer outage
- 11/25(Sat.) 　　　　　Legal power outage
- 11/26(Sun.)～11/29(Wed.) Supercomputer scheduled maintenance work (UPS maintenance, Lustre maintenance, software updates, etc.)
- 11/30(Thu.) is a spare day.


## Work Description

Works for scheduled maintenance are as follows.

1. Software version upgrade 
2. OS migration (from CentOS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS)
    - [FAQ page for OS migration has been created.](/guides/FAQ/faq_os_migration/)＼&#x1f195;／
    - The medium nodes and the fat node hardware (that is, HPE ProLiant DL560 Gen10 and HPE Superdome Flex) do not support Ubuntu Linux and could not be migrated from Cent OS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04 this time.
3. Grid Engine version upgrade 
4. yum update for Cent OS that did not migrate OS 
5. Firmware and device driver version upgrade for InfininBand and Lustre 
6. LDAP configuration changes 
7. UPS inspection work

CUDA is downgraded to 12.1 because the supported version of the Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS GA kernel is 12.1.

### OS migration (from CentOS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS)

As CentOS 7 will reach End-Of-Life on 30 June 2024, the migration from CentOS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS will be performed during scheduled maintenance.

- All compute nodes in the general analysis division will be migrated from CentOS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS. With this, **the analysis environment may need to be re-installed. Please make sure to check the development environment and reinstall the analysis environment on your own.**
- Users who are using occupied compute nodes will be asked by email whether you would like to migrate your OS during scheduled maintenance. Please let us know when the OS migration is convenient for you.


#### The Personal Genome Analysis Section

- The GPU compute nodes under Slurm will be migrated from CentOS 7.9 to Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS. With this, **the analysis environment may need to be re-installed. Please make sure to check the development environment and reinstall the analysis environment on your own.**
- Users who are using occupied compute nodes will be asked by email whether you would like to migrate your OS during scheduled maintenance. Please let us know when the OS migration is convenient for you.


## Notes
- Running jobs will be deleted, so please resubmit jobs after the scheduled maintenance.
