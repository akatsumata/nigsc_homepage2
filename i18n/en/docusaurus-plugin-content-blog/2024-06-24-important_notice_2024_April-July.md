The Medium node is currently running on CentOS 7.9, but as Cent OS 7 will be out of support (EOL) at the end of June.We will gradually change to Ubuntu Linux 22.04.

We will create a new medium-ubuntu.q queue in GridEngine and migrate the Medium nodes that have been changed to Ubuntu Linux 22.04 to this queue sequentially.When you submit a job to the medium-ubuntu.q queue, the job will be run in the Medium node on Ubuntu Linux 22.04, and when you submit a job to the Medium.q queue, the job will be run in the Medium node on Cent OS 7.9.
One or two Cent OS 7.9 Medium nodes will also remain.
