The following applications will be accepted as before.

- For current already large-scale users for the general analysis division and the personal genome analysis division users, we will continue to accept additions of resources to chang the usage plan table as before.
- Regular creating an account of the general analysis division will also be accepted as before. In this case, the disk memory will be limited to the default setting of 1TB.
- For using of the service for workshops, etc.

Thank you for your understanding that we may not be able to meet your request in such cases.

The timing for resuming the account application will be decided by checking the availability of computer resources.
