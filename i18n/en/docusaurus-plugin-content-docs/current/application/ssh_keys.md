## Procedures for registering and changing SSH public keys

Create the SSH public and private key required for secure user authentication on the user's computer.
To create them, use a terminal emulator for Mac or Linux (PowerShell for Windows).

make sure OpenSSH is installed on the user's computer before starting the process. For information on how to install OpenSSH on Windows PowerShell, read, for example, [&#x1f517;<u>Microsoft's corresponding page</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).
