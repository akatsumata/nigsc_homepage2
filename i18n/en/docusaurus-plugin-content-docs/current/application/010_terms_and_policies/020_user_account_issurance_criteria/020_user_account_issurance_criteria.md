## Target users of the NIG supercomputer {#target-users}

As a member of the Inter-University Research Institute Corporation, National Institute of Genetics operates a supercomputer system for the purpose of providing resources for life science research and education focusing on genetics.

As a general rule, users can use the NIG supercomputer for free. But from the viewpoint of business continuity and promotion of efficient use of computational resources, we provides billing services for storage of especially large-scale data and using additional services.

On the other hand, the supercomputer system is subject to **Export Administration Regulations under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA)**, and are subject to punishment if used for weapons manufacturing purposes. In the context of these circumstances, in the NIG supercomputer, we issue login user accounts for the following people.

1. A domestic resident as prescribed in FEFTA, and  a faculty member of a university or a public research institute
2. A collaborative researcher of 1. or a researcher, a student, a researcher of contractors, etc. under the guidance of 1. (including international students, overseas job transfer, overseas researchers)


## User's responsibilities

- In principle, the purpose of use and results are open to the public. 
    - However, if you want to postpone the release date, contact us.
- From the viewpoint of security traceability, specify **the responsible person** when applying for use.
    - The responsible person must be the above "A domestic resident as prescribed in FEFTA, and  a faculty member of a university or a public research institute".
    - The resource usage is calculated for each group under the responsibility of the manager and is considered when determining charges for the use of the billing service.
    - To use the billing service, the responsible person must submit a usage plan table. Therefore, you will not be unintentionally charged without the consent of the responsible person.
- From the viewpoint of security traceability, it is strictly prohibited to share the user account with multiple people and to use the NIG supercomputer for purposes other than the purpose for which you have applied.
- If you violate it, we may take measures such as suspending your account.


## The responsible person's responsibilities

The responsible person must agree to the following.

1. Research results using the supercomputer will be basically published, but at that time, the responsible person is a public decision maker.
2. The responsible person belongs to an institution that has no problem in use in light of the purpose of the Inter-University Research Institute Corporation.
3. To guide the user not to use the NIG supercomputer for purposes other than those applied by the user, and from the perspective of traceability of the cause and responsibility when something unexpected happens, the user and the responsible person must be able to verify the identity, identification, and contact information can be done at your institution.
4. When a bill is issued to the responsible person when a charge is incurred, the billing must be able to handled by the office work in your institution. Consider this regardless of whether or not a bill is actually issue at this time.


If there is no problem with these, the user themselves can be the responsible person.
