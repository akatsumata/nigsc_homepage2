## Configuration file types {#configfile-types}

There is a configuration file for each of the HCP tools commands.

| #| command  |location of configuration files| feature                                          |
|--|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1| `hcp`    |~/.hcp/hcp.conf                | copy files on the server                         |
| 2| `hrm`    |~/.hcp/hrm.conf                | delete files on the server                       |
| 3| `hcp-ls` |~/.hcp/hcp-ls.conf             | list files on the server                         |
| 4| `hmkdir` |~/.hcp/hmkdir.conf             | create directories on the server                 |
| 5| `hpwd`   |~/.hcp/hpwd.conf               | retrieve the working directory on the server     |
| 6| `hmv`    |~/.hcp/hmv.conf                | move files on the server                         |
| 7| `hln`    |~/.hcp/hln.conf                | create file's links on the server                |
| 8| `hchmod` |~/.hcp/hchmod.conf             | change the file's permission on the server       |
| 9| `hchown` |~/.hcp/hchown.conf             | change the file's owner on the server            |
|10| `hsync`  |~/.hcp/hsync.conf              | synchronize files on the server                  |



There are many configuration files, so we recommend that you create a new configuration file named `~/.hcp/hcp-common.conf` to describe common settings and include (read) from each configuration file. Add the following line at the top line of each of the above 10 configuration files such as `~/.hcp/hcp.conf`. (The path must be written in absolute path.)


For Linux

```
Include /home/username/.hcp/hcp-common.conf
```

For Windows

```
Include C:\Users\username\_hcp\hcp-common.conf
```


## An example of the common configuration file (`~/.hcp/hcp-common.conf`) {#setteing-ex-hcp-common-conf}

Normally write the contents of `hcp-common.conf` as follows.

```
PrivateKeyFile /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa    # Specify the private key
AcceptableCryptMethod   PLAIN              ã€€# Encryption: None
AcceptableDigestMethod  SHA256               # Digest format: SHA256
DisableDataIntegrityChecking yes             # Allow no digest format
```

(For Windows, you must specify `C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_rsa` for the pricate key.)

### Specify the private key {#setteing-ex-hcp-common-conf#specify-seckey}

HCP tools authenticates users using the public/private keys.

In this case, you can use the public/private key files used for SSH login to the NIG supercomputer as the public/private keys.
If you use them, make sure that the private key file (`id_rsa`) addresses under the user directory in the client computer (`C:\Users\username\.ssh` for Windows). (When you follow [how to set up the public key for SSH](/application/ssh_keys_mac), the private key file should already be here.)


### Encryption {#setteing-ex-hcp-common-conf#encrypt}

It is not necessary to encrypt by HCPtools because the personal genome analysis division is used SSL-VPN connection.
Therefore, normally there is no problem when you create the file with the following content and set it up as `~/.hcp/hcp-hcp-common.conf`.

### Digest format {#setteing-ex-hcp-common-conf#digest-format}

This is the setting for check that datas are not corrupted or tampered in file transfers. Normally, enable this setting.
When you check the integrity of files, add the `-y` option.

Example

```bash
hcp --user username --hpfp -y  \
    gwa.ddbj.nig.ac.jp:/home/your_account-pg/some_directory/your_file.txt \
    C:\Users\username\your_file.txt
```
