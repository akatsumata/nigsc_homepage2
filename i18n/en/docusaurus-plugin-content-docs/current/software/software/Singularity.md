## Introduction

Singularity containers are available on the NIG supercomputer to install various analysis software with user permission.

By using Singularity, for example, it is possible to run analysis software installed by Ubuntu Linux apt-get etc. on the NIG supercomputer (CentOS 7.9).

## Creating images with Singularity - The basic procedures

The Singularity container is generally used in the following procedure.

- (i) Create an analysis environment in sandbox mode on a local server with root privileges.
- (ii) singularity build it and create archive Singularity container image file (*.sif)
- (iii) Copy this file to a shared computer such as a supercomputer. 1
- (iv) Execute the program in the container with user permission on the supercomputer.

The container image file (*.sif) is originally write-protected to avoid security issues when the container is brought onto the shared computer.

Here's the example of using the Singularity Definition File.

First, create a Singularity container image file in the user's own Linux environment. (For information on installing Singularity itself, read the official page [Quick Start â€” Singularity container 3.5 documentation ](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html).


```
# For example, clone the Singularity Definition File from the following site to the user's linux server.
git clone https://github.com/oogasawa/singularity-ubuntu18

# Build this Definition file to create a Singularity container image file.
# (For more information about building, See above README.md of the github repository)
cd singularity-ubuntu18
sudo apt-get debootstrap
sudo singularity build ubuntu18.sif Singularity
```

Copy the Singularity container image file created as described above onto the NIG supercomputer.

(Or, the above build process takes more than an hour, so build it in the background by registering it on the singularity-hub in advance, and download the Singularity container image file from the singularity-hub to the NIG supercomputer. )

Execute the following on the NIG supercomputer.

```
# Get the Singularity container image from singularity-hub
singularity pull shub://oogasawa/singularity-ubuntu18
# Set alias to prevent long commands
alias sing="singularity exec $HOME/ubuntu18.sif
# Use it
```


## Building images on the supercomputer : Generating Singularity images from Docker container images

You can use a Docker container instead of Singularity's sandbox mode. Using this method, you can build (create) a Singularity image on the supercomputer. (The Docker container image file must be registered in the Docker Hub in advance.)

The example of using Singularity with the Docker container image is as follows:

```
# Specify the amount of memory in advance when qlogin because the error saying there is not enough memory occurs when building singularity.
$ qlogin -l s_vmem=20G -l mem_req=20G

## Use the Singularity image installed on the supercomputer

For reducing the time and effort of installing analysis software, there are more than 34,000 Singularity container image files provided by biocontainers under the /usr/local/biotools/ directory on the NIG supercomputer.
 

The usage example is as follows:
```
# It's good to set alias to prevent the command from becoming too long.
$ alias singR="singularity exec /usr/local/biotools/r/r-base:3.5.1 R"

$ singR --no-save < example.R
> attach(mtcars)
> plot(wt, mpg)
> abline(lm(mpg~wt))
> title("Regression of MPG on Weight")
>

```
