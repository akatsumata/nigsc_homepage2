## Intel oneMKL (Math Kernel Library) {#intel_one-math-kernel-lib}

The NIG supercomputer allows the use of the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which accelerates mathematical processing routines such as linear algebra, fast Fourier transforms, and vector operations.

- Dense linear algebra routines from BLAS and LAPACK
- Sparse BLAS sparse linear algebra routines
- Random number generators
- Vector math routines optimized for vector operations
- Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)

Please check the following directory:
```
/lustre7/software/intel_ubuntu/oneapi/mkl/2023.2.0/lib/intel64
```
