The NIG supercomputer system has installed the ***Intel oneAPI Base & HPC Toolkit Multi-node***, enabling the use of the following tools. For details about each product, please refer to the following sites:

- [List of products and features included in the suite product (vendor site)](https://www.xlsoft.com/jp/products/intel/oneapi/bundle.html)
- [oneAPI programming guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/2023-0/overview.html)
- [Intel oneAPI specification](https://spec.oneapi.io/versions/latest/index.html)

You may consider using Intel's compiler, libraries, and development environments over open-source compilers such as gcc in the following cases:

- When you want to build and optimize open-source numerical libraries by yourself, especially if you want to build libraries written in FORTRAN.
  - [(Example)Using oneMKL with R](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/using-onemkl-with-r.html)
- When building programs that use multi-threading programming standards like OpenMP, especially for FORTRAN.
- When you want to use Python modules like numpy, scikit-learn, and scipy, which are fast and use Intel MKL internally (Intel Distribution for Python).
  - [Intel's overview document on Python acceleration (2018, a bit old but good for an overview)](https://jp.xlsoft.com/documents/intel/python/2018/greeneltch_fastpython.pdf)
- When you want to develop programs using various mathematical functions supported by Intel MKL.
- When you want to use libraries optimized for Intel hardware features and generate optimized code with detailed compiler options.
- When you want to fine-tune or debug programs using OpenMP, MPI, etc., with tools like VTune Profiler and TraceAnalyzer.

The table below provides an overview of the components available on the NIG supercomputer.

It is possible to install Intel's tools on your own computer for software creation and debugging, and then use the NIG supercomputer system for computations requiring large resources.

Below, we explain an overview and the basic usage of the components available on the NIG supercomputer. Please note that directory paths in execution logs, such as `2024.0`, indicate the situation at the time of article creation and may change

 with updates. Please interpret the actual situation accordingly.

## Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler {#intel-one-api-dpc-compailer}

The NIG supercomputer allows the use of the Intel OneAPI DPC++/C++ compiler.

The Intel compiler is available by default.

```
 yxxxx@at138:~$ which icx
/lustre7/software/intel_ubuntu/oneapi/compiler/2024.0/bin/icx
 yxxxx@at138:~$ which icpx
/lustre7/software/intel_ubuntu/oneapi/compiler/2024.0/bin/icpx
```

To execute binaries with advanced optimizations, please run them on compute nodes equipped with Intel CPUs (they will also work on AMD CPUs). For the general division, please refer to the queue configuration.

- [Queue configuration in AGE](/general_analysis_division/ga_queue/)

### Compiler Command Formats {#intel-one-api-dpc-compailer#command-format}

| Language | Command | Execution Format |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| C  | icx  | icx [options] filename |
| C++  | icpx  | icpx [options] filename |

### Main Options {#intel-one-api-dpc-compailer#main-option}

Here are the summaries of the main options available with the Intel compiler:

| Option Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| -o FILENAME | Specifies the name of the object file. |
| -mcmodel=medium | Allows memory usage exceeding 2GB. |
| -shared-intel | Dynamically links all libraries provided by Intel. |
| -qopenmp | Compiles with OpenMP directives enabled. |
| -qmkl | Links MKL library. |
| -parallel | Enables automatic parallelization. |
| -O0 / -O1 / -O2 / -O3 | Specifies the optimization level (default is -O2). |
| -fast | Optimizes to maximize program execution speed. Includes options: -ipo, -O3, -static, -fp-model fast=2 by default. |
| -ip | Optimizes procedures within a single file. |
| -ipo | Optimizes procedures across multiple files. May significantly increase compilation time. |
| -xCORE-AVX512 / -xCORE-AVX2 | Generates optimized code for specified instruction sets for Intel processors. |
| -static-intel | Static links libraries provided by Intel. |

The vendor recommends using the -fast option as a basic check.

For detailed options, refer to Intel's site:
