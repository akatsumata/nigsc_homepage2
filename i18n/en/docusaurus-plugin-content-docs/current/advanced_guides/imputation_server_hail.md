This Tutorial 3 describes how to set up an environment for analysing the results of an imputation server's imputation results in [&#x1f517;<u>hail</u>](https://hail.is)  to analyse the results of an imputation server.

## Connecting to NIG Guacamole desktop environment

You need to sign in to NIG Guacamole desktop environment via VPN first.

Next, please launch the terminal from the "Activities" in the Guacamole desktop environment.

You need to run the following tutorial in the terminal that you launched above.

## If you do not have a conda environment

If you already have a conda environment, skip the following `miniconda installation` and go on to `create environment with conda`.

### Installing miniconda

As Anaconda requires a paid licence for some uses, it is recommended that you install miniconda and `conda'.

In the following, miniconda and `conda-forge` are used.

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod 755 ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Leave and re-enter the working environment terminal or SSH.

Check that conda is available.

```
which conda
conda --version
```


### Creating the conda environment

Create Jupyter and Hail environments in the following method

```
conda create -c conda-forge -n hail-python37-openjdk8 python=3.7 openjdk=8
```

Activate the development environment:

```
conda activate hail-python37-openjdk8
```

To deactivate (when exiting) the conda environment:

```
conda deactivate
```


## Installing Jupyter and hail

In the conda environment for Jupyter and hail, execute the following commands.

```
pip install hail
pip install jupyter
```

The following commands are also required. This means that 48G of memory is allocated for hail.
If this memory is low, hail will output an out-of-memory error and the calculation will not be able to resume.

```
export PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS='--driver-memory 48g --executor-memory 48g pyspark-shell'
```

Also create the following working directory for the tutorial notebook.

### Creating directory

```
mkdir ~/prs-on-hail
```

### Starting Jupyter

```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=~/prs-on-hail
```

To actually on a supercomputer, see [<u>the Jupyter Notebook page</u>](/software/jupyter_notebook).


### Checking Hail startup

Create one new Jupyter Notebook, enter the following in the first cell and run it.

```
import hail as hl
```

Enter the following in the next cell and run it.

```
hl.init()
```

Check that there are no errors.

### Notebook for performing PRS calculations using the imputation results as input to hail

Refer to the following notebook and use hail on Jupyter.
