## Configuration and usage

### Installing jq

The command `jq` is essential, so if you don't have it, install it.

The following command checks if `jq` exists. If it exists, the path to `jq` is returned. If it does not exist, an error is returned with a message that it does not exist.

```
which jq
```

If it does not exist, use the following command to get `jq` and grant execute permission.
The following example assumes that `~/bin` is present in the PATH environment variable. If not, execute `mkdir ~/bin` and add `~/bin` to the PATH environment variable.


```
curl -L -o ~/bin/jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-linux64
chmod 755 ~/bin/jq
```

Execute `which jq` again to ensure `jq` is available.

### How to set up and run services {#set-run-service}

There is a script to set up this system and run the service.

#### Running the script

Log in to the guacamole virtual machine.

Use the following commands to install the essentials and run the service.

```
cp /usr/local/shared_data/imputation-server/imputation-desktop/scripts/install.sh install.sh
./install.sh
```

By default, the essentials are installed under `$HOME/sapporo-install`.

If you want to change the installation directory, change `INSTALLDIR` in the script.

The script will install the following in the specified directory.

- Python 3.9.7
- Node.js v14.17.6
- ImputationServer web ui
- Sapporo web 1.0.10
- Sapporo Service 1.0.16

Installation completed.


### Note: If you are asked for input during the process, enter 'n'. {#note}

During script execution, if the following screen appears and waits for input, enter 'n' and continue. (After pressing 'n', press the Enter key.)
