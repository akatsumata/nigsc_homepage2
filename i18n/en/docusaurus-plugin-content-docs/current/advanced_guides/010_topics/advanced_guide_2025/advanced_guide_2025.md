"PortablePipeline is a software tool that enables GUI-based NGS analysis on local computers, remote servers, or supercomputers, with client support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
On standalone Windows systems, it runs via WSL and Docker; on macOS, via Homebrew and Docker; and on Linux servers with Grid Engine, it supports SGE for distributed job execution on platforms such as the Shirogane and the NIG supercomputers.
Additionally, analysis scripts written according to the software’s specifications can be easily executed from CUI." (Referenced from the PortablePipeline page on GitHub)
