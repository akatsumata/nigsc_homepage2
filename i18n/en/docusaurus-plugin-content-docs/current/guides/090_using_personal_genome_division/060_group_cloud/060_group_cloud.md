DDBJ Group Cloud is a service for sharing data that requires access restrictions, including personal genome data, within a research group.

- OwnCloud or MinIO can be used to fine-tune database access permissions rights.
  - [OwnCloud Official Website](https://owncloud.com/)
  - [MinIO Official Website](https://min.io/)

- In combination with Remote Desktop, downloading of data to the user's client computer can be prohibited. (Please indicate the amount of compute resources you want to use in the the Extended Service Usage Plan submitted at the time of application.)
    - The remote desktop environment is used from the web browser of the user's computer (e.g. Windows or Mac).
    - Data sharing is also possible by accessing the data sharing middleware (MinIO or OwnCloud shown in the window at the bottom right of the screen) on the Linux desktop. Data download from the data sharing middleware to the user's computer can be configured to be possible or not by the default settings of the environment.
    - Analysis calculations can be performed using a GUI environment on a Linux desktop.
    - By adding computation nodes, jobs can be run using the job scheduler from a terminal emulator in the Linux environment running on the remote desktop.
