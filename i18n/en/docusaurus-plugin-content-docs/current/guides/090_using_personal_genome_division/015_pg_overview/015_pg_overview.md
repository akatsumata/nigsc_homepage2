title: "Overview of How to Use the personal genome analysis division"
---

- For security reasons, users are generally required to use dedicated (exclusive) compute nodes in the personal genome analysis division, so that they cannot see the job statuses of other users.

- However, due to the particularly limited number of L40S GPU nodes (Accelerator-optimised node Type 2), these are made available through a shared, GPU-dedicated Slurm job scheduler in order to maximise computational efficiency.

1. In either case, users must first log in to the personal genome analysis division gateway via SSL-VPN.  
2. For all nodes other than the L40S GPU nodes, users access their dedicated compute nodes via SSH from the gateway. It is also possible to submit jobs to oneâ€™s own dedicated node using Slurm from within that node.  
3. When using an L40S GPU node (Accelerator-optimised node Type 2), users should log in via SSH to the interactive node designated for L40S GPU access.
