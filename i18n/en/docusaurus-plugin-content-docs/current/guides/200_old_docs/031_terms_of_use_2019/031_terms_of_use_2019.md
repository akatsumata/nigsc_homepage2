## Price list (Revised on 2023)

Terms of Use for Supercomputer Systems of the National Institute of Genetics, the Research Organization of Information and Systems

### **Appendix 1（Pertaining to Article 12）**

Price for the Use for the general analysis division large-scale(excluding tax)

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" rowspan="3">high-speed storage<br />(※1)</td>
			<td>Free 30TB or less</td>
			<td>0 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>If it exceeds 30TB, per 10TB a year</td>
			<td>27,778 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2">Example: Used capacity is 30TB or more and less than 40TB 111,112 yen<br /> Used capacity is 40TB or more and less than 50TB 138,890 yen </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="4">priority use of compute nodes  (※2)</td>
			<td>Thin node<br />(AMD)</td>
			<td>One CPU core, 4GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>448 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Thin node(Intel)</td>
			<td>One CPU core, 12GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>448 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Thin node<br />(Intel/NVIDIA GPU)</td>
			<td>6 CPU cores, 1GPU, 96GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>56,250 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Medium node</td>
			<td>13 CPU cores, 512GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>29,155 yen</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The billing amount is prorated based on the number of days used.

(※1) Set the maximum available limit (quota) for a user or group. When storage is extremely congested, the storage capacity limit may be reached before the upper limit is reached.

(※2) The compute node priority use service is a service that reserves execution using the advanced reservation function of the grid engine.

### **Appendix 2（Pertaining to Article 12）**

Price for the Use for the personal genome analysis division large-scale(excluding tax)

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" rowspan="2">high-speed storage<br />(※1)</td>
			<td>Basic Bill</td>
			<td>83,333 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>per 10TB a year</td>
			<td>27,778 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DDBJ Group Cloud</td>
			<td>Basic Bill</td>
			<td>per project Annual amount</td>
			<td>3,500,000 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="4">Access Restricted Data Group Shared Database Service(※2)</td>
			<td>archive storage (Capacity Guarantee)</td>
			<td>per 10TB a year</td>
			<td>40,000 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The Request and Response Development</td>
			<td>one man-month</td>
			<td>1,300,000 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The Request and Response Work</td>
			<td>one man-month</td>
			<td>250,000 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Supports data transportation with high capacity disks up to 100TB </td>
			<td>Per transaction</td>
			<td>40,000 yen
(postage excluded)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The billing amount is prorated based on the number of days used.

(※1) Set the maximum available limit (quota) for a user or group. When storage is extremely congested, the storage capacity limit may be reached before the upper limit is reached.

(※2) A service that uploads data to the cloud and shares it among researchers who are permitted to access the data. Includes initial installation costs, security monitoring, and personnel costs for operation.
If additional development is required, such as support for different data structures, a separate development fee is required in addition to the basic fee. Prices may change from the next fiscal year onward due to changes in circumstances.



### **Appendix 3（Pertaining to Article 12）**

Price for the Use for the occupancy compute node of the general analysis division and the personal genome analysis division(excluding tax)

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="5">the occupancy compute node (※)</td>
			<td>Thin node<br />(AMD)</td>
			<td>One CPU core, 8GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>448 yen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Thin node<br />(Intel)</td>
			<td>One CPU core, 12GB memory as a single unit, a single unit per 30 days</td>
			<td>448 yen</td>
