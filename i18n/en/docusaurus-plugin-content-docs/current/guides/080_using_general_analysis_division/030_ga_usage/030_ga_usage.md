On the interactive node, you can do development work and perform analysis work as a normal Linux system.

- As for the development environment, etc., refer to "[the Development Environment and Libraries](/guides/software/#dev-environment-and-libraries)" on [the Software page](/guides/software).
- You can work on the interactive node for up to 3 days. You will be forcibly logged out after qlogin.

For calculations that take a long time or use a large CPU or memory, run them as batch jobs, parallel jobs, or array jobs on the compute node (compute node) with the qsub command.
