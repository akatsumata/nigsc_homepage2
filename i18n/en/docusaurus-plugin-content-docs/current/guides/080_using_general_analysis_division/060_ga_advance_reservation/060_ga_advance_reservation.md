## Overview

Advance Reservation is a service that users reserve a certain range of resources in the Grid Engine queue before using and can use exclusively the reserved area.

Note: this service is a billing service, so you must submit a usage plan before you use it.


![](advance_reservation.png)

The red dotted square shows the resources taken by the advance reservation (number of slots on the compute nodes ✕ usage time) and the other squares show the resources occupied by the job (number of slots used on compute nodes ✕ calculation time). The user who reserved the area can submit the job to the red square area.

(Users using the Advance Reservation Service can submit as usual jobs without using the reserved quota for computational resources by using the `qsub` command as well as users not using the Advance Reservation Service.)


About the billing period
- When you get the reserved quota for computational resources and delete it before the end time after start using, the time from the start time to the delet time of it is subject to billing.(Normally this pattern)
- When you didn't delet the reserved quota, all the time from the start time to the end time is subject to billing.
    - When it is the end time of the reserved quota, the job is forcibly terminated even if the job is running.
    - All the reserved quota is subject to billing even if you don't execute the job on the reserved quota. 
- When you get the reserved quota for computational resources and delete it before the start time of it, it becomes invalid and is not subject to billing.




## Instruction for using Advance Reservation Service

To use the Advance Reservation Service, follow the steps below.

1. Submit the usage plan
    - This service is a billing service and you must submit a usage plan before you start using it. Refer to "[How to use billing service](/application/billing_services)" for more information on its process.
2. Get the reserved quota for computational resources
    - To get the reserved quota for computational resources using the `QRSUB` command. 
3. Confirm the reserved quota for computational resources
    - To confirm the reserved quota of computational resources using the `qrstat` command. 
4. Execute jobs
    - To execute jobs after getting the reserved quota for computational resources using the `qsub` command by specifying `ar-id` (reservation number) with the `-ar` option.
5. Delet the reserved quota for computational resources
    - To delet the reserved quota for computational resources using the `QRDEL` command.


The `QRSUB` and `QRDEL` commands are wrapper programs for Grid Engine's `qrsub` and `qrdel` commands created to calculate billing on the NIG supercomputer.
Both `QRSUB` and `QRDEL` command options are available for the `qrsub` and `qrdel` commands, respectively.
for the options of each command, refer to the Grid Engine User's Manual (English only).

## How to get the reserved quota for computational resources

When you get the reserved quota, you can ask supercomputer SE to reserve it, or you can reserve it yourself with the command.

It may not be possible to get it with `QRSUB` because there are no available resources depending on the running job.
In such a case, move the date and time to be reserved it to a future date and time, and execute the `QRSUB` command again.



### Execution example (1)

When you get the reserved quota for computer resorces using medium.q with one node, 4GB of memory, 3 slots, from April 2, 13:15, 2020 to May 4, 10:00, 2020, the memory is allocated 12GB (GB of memory x 3 slots). In getting it, you need available memory for it.

```
QRSUB -l medium -l mem_req=4G -l s_vmem=4G -pe def_slot 3 -a 202004021315 -e 202005041000
```

- `-l medium`：Specify medium.q
- `-l mem_req=4G -l s_vmem=4G`：Specify 4GB of memory
- `-pe def_slot 3`：Specify 3 slots (Number of slots requested is reserved by 1 node)
- `-a 202004021315`：Specify the start using time at 13:15 on April 2, 2020
- `-e 202005041000`：Specify the end to use time at 10:00 on May 4, 2020


### Execution example (2)

When you get the reserved quota for computer resorces using medium.q with the mpi job (parallel number is 2~5) that spans multiple nodes, 4GB of memory, 3 slots, from October 10, 00:00 to October 20, 7:05, the memory is allocated 12GB (GB of memory x 3 slots). In getting it, you need available memory for it.

```
QRSUB -l medium -pe mpi 2-10 -a 10100000 -e 10200705
```

- `-pe mpi 2-5`  : Specify minimum number of parallelism 2, maximum number of parallelism 5 on the mpi job
- `-a 10100000`  : Specify the start using time at 13:15 on October 10
- `-e 10200705` : Specify the end to use time at 7:05 on October 20

＊The memory is not specified, so the specified memory is considered the default value.
 
### Execution Result

When the `QRSUB` command completes successfully, you will get the following message and a ar-id (4-digit reservation number) is issued.

```
Your advance reservation XXXX has been granted
```

XXXX : ar-id(reservation number).

When the `QRSUB` command does not complete successfully, check the specified options and try again.

### How to specify the reservation start time and end time

Specify the reservation start time and end time using the following arguments with the `QRSUB` command.

- `-a start-time` Specifies the reservation start time. Specify "start-time" in the following format.
- `-e end-time` Specifies the end time which reserved. 	Specify "end-time" in the following format.

To specify the time, use in the following format.
- CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS
- CCYYMMDDhhmm
- YYMMDDhhmm.SS
- YYMMDDhhmm
- MMDDhhmm.SS
- MMDDhhmm 	-

＊CC：the first two digits of the year　YY：the last two digits of the year　MM：Month　DD：Date　hh：Time　mm：Min　SS：Sec

## How to execute the job

Specify `ar-id` (reservation number) with the` -ar` option of the `qsub` command, and execute the job.

For options, see [the Grid Engine page](/guides/old_docs/software/JobScheduler/grid_engine).

If you execute the qsub command with `ar-id` before the start time of the reserved slot of the computational resource and submit the job, the job is executed as soon as the start time of the reserved slot comes.

Note that the executing job will be forced quit when the end time of the acquired reserved slot has passed.


 
## Delete the reserved slot for computational resources

Execute the `QRDEL` command with `ar-id` (reserved number) to delete the reserved slot for computational resources.

Example:

```
QRDEL ar-id
```

Note: If "⑤ delet the reserved quota for computational resources (QRDEL command)" is executed while a job is running, the running job will also be terminated.
