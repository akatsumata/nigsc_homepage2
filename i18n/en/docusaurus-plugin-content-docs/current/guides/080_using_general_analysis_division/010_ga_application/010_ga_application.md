Send back the Pledge(PDF) [with reference to the 'Steps to sign a PDF'](/application/agreement_signing).
    - The email will be sent in a few days after completing the application form.
3. Wait for your account registration certificate to arrive.
    - It takes about a week to mail your account registration certidicate by post after you sent the pledge(PDF).
    - It takes longer time if the examination is required by the Organization such as foreign exchange law.
