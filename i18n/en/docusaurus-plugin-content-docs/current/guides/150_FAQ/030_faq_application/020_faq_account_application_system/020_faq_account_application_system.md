## &#x1F180; When applying for new use, I applied for use without entering my SSH public key in the account application form. I have already completed the account application, but without registering my SSH public key. What should I do? {#regist-ssh-pubkey}

&#x1F150; You do not need to register a new application again.

Please wait for your account registration certificate to be sent to you by post.

After you received your account registration certificate, 
login from the following link and register your SSH public key.
