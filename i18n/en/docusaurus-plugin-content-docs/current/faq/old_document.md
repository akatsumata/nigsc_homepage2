## How to Login (The general analysis division) {#gen-login}

### &#x1F180; I have reconfigured my ssh public key again, but I get a error message `Permission denied` and cannot connect. {#gen-login#gen-sshlogin-permission-denied}

&#x1F150; As of 7 July 2022, we move the data to a new application system for use ("[<u>July 5, 2022(Monday) Application system for new use is new</u>](/blog/2022-07-05-news_NewApp)").
Therefore, public key registrations to the new gateway `gw2.ddbj.nig.ac.jp` will be reflected immediately, but it will take about one day for the settings to be reflected to the old gateway `gw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp`.
At the next scheduled maintenance (December), the system will be modified so that the settings will be reflected immediately on the old gateway.

Please login from `gw2.ddbj.nig.ac.jp` immediately after setting your public key etc.

### &#x1F180; What is the difference between high-speed storage and archive storage? {#billing-usage#dif-storage-highspeed-archive}

&#x1F150; Archive storage is the strage where the DNA sequence data of NIG is stored, and is also used for special projects such as AMED AGD. As for supercomputer users, use high-speed storage (You can use it up to 30TB for free).
